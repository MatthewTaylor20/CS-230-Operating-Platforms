# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

The Gaming Room is a client that has a game where teams guess what is being drawn but instead of someone drawing the pictures, the application displays images for people to guess. This client has asked for an evaluation of the Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile operating systems to determine how the app can be refactored and deployed to accomodate these additional platforms. I felt that in developing this documentation, I did particularly well with the section titled Domain Model. Setting up the relationships between objects and how those objects should be defined went well. Laying out a clear plan ahead of time makes the development fairly straitforward. I would probably add more information in the analysis of each operating system if I could revise any of it. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because if the user doesn't have what they need, they won't use the product. When designing the software, I made sure to design it in a way that the user would be able to use any platform and have a good experience regardless of which one they chose. I think that the approach of a client-server model would be a really good approach to use on any projects in the future that are similar to this one.
